# J. ColElfjes Poem Generator

This project generates poems using the lyrics of J. Cole's songs "Lights Please," "No Role Modelz," and "Middle Child". It processes the lyrics to tokenize and tag parts of speech, and then generates poetic lines based on predefined grammar rules using the RiTa.js library.
