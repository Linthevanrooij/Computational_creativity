# Log file of Computational Creativity Poem Generator 

## Initial Idea of poetry generator
As inspiring set of the poem generator we chose rap lyrics. Rap lyrics in general is being said to be poetic. To not mix different styles, we chose to only select the lyrics of one artist to be included in the data set. As artist we chose one to be known as one of the most poetic rap artist in general: JCole or Kendrick Lamar ([Rap poets](https://medium.com/writers-daily/why-poets-should-be-like-rappers-0b21a8bdff77#:~:text=Myriad%20rappers%20have%20been%20called,poets%20and%20the%20new%20rappers)). We began with a dataset of only one song to start simple, we chose his best known song: Lights Please (the final idea is to make the generator based on different songs of JCole/Kendrick). 

As for the implementation of poem generator, we first explored the different available techniques (grammar, templates, markov chains) and from there, chose one that suits are project the best. For the format we want to use an "elfje" (Didactic cinquain). This is a structure composed of 5 lines in which the first line includes 1 word, the second 2 words, the third 3 words, the fourth 4 words, the fifth 1 words again. 
Predefined rules on these lines ((http://www.poezie-in-beweging.nl/framerechts/poezie_en_opdrachten/maakeeneigengedicht/elfje.htm)) 

For the presentation we want to use an generative AI that produces text-to-speech in a rap format ([GenerativeAI](https://www.topmediai.com/app/text-to-speech/?voice=67ade205-5d4b-11ee-a861-00163e2ac61b)), rapped by JCole/Kendrick itself! And maybe we want to include a beat in the final record.
